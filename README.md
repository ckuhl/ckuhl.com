Personal website of Chris Kuhl. Written in Django for flexibility in what I
can create with it. Deployed using Ansible to make updating the site simpler.


## To - do

### Site apps

- [ ] New app: Ideas
	- Repository for "you know what would be cool?" ideas
	- Tweet-sized thoughts about anything and everything


### Project

		- [ ] Cover more cases
		- [ ] Cover more code
		- [ ] Cover functions that hit the DB
