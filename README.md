My personal website. Written in Django so I have some flexibilty in what I can
do with it. Deployed with Ansible so I don't have to think about updates.

## To - do

Lots!

- [ ] Blog / Portfolio:
  - [x] Create paragraph teaser functionality
  - [x] Prevent images from appearing in the teaser (just don't put any images at the start...)
  - [ ] Store tags in related table
- [ ] Analytics
  - [ ] Create local analytics (for e.g. user-agents, etc.)
  - [ ] Admin dashboard(?)
- [ ] Core
  - [ ] Respectful tracking (DNT)

### Frontend
- [x] Use native fonts
- [ ] Use _less_: trim down Bootstrap + theme to be lighter
- [ ] Establish build pipeline (build bootstrap, etc. from scratch)
