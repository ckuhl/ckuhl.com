# My `personal_site` â€” ChristianKuhl.com
The personal website, resume, and blog of Christian Kuhl.

This is intended to be a showcase of my abilities, both from a computer
science perspective and from a business / communication perspective.

Built primarily using Python3, Flask, and Flask-Flatpages.


## Running the project
Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and the
virtual environment is stored in `.venv/`. However it's git-ignored so that
everyone builds their own from the latest versions). In theory all you should
need to do to run this site is:
1. `git clone https://bitbucket.org/ckuhl/flask-personal-site.git`

2. `cd personal_site`

3. `virtualenv -p python3 .venv`

4. `pip3 install requirements.txt`


## Project structure
* `/` init script and setup files
	* `/.venv` python virtual environment
	* `/static` all the static files the website serves
		* `/css`
		* `/img`
		* `/js`
	* `/templates` HTML fragments that site uses
		* `/base` base fragments -- footer, header, container
		* `/blog` blog partials
		* `/pages` display pages off of the main site


## Website structure
* `/` (homepage)
    * `/about`
    * `/contact`
    * `/blog`
        * `/posts` -- only used with a slug for each blog post
    * `/portfolio`
