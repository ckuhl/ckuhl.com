# My `personal_site` â€” ckuhl.com
The personal website, resume, and blog of Christian Kuhl.

This is intended to be a showcase of my abilities, both from a computer
science perspective and from a business / communication perspective.

Built primarily using Python3, Flask, and Flask-Flatpages.


## Running the project
Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt` and the
virtual environment is stored in `.venv/`. However it's git-ignored so that
everyone builds their own from the latest versions). In theory all you should
need to do to run this site is:
1. `git clone https://bitbucket.org/ckuhl/flask-personal-site.git`

2. `cd flask-personal-site`

3. `virtualenv -p python3 --no-site-packages env`

4. `source ./env/bin/activate`

5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Project structure
- `/` init script and setup files
	- `/env` python virtual environment
	- `/static` all the static files the website serves
