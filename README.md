My personal website. Written in Django so I have some flexibilty in what I can
do with it. Deployed with Ansible so I don't have to think about updates.


## To - do

- [ ] Blog / Portfolio:
  - [ ] Store tags in related table
  - [ ] On loading pages, rewrite URLs for images

- [ ] Analytics
  - [ ] Create local analytics (for e.g. user-agents, etc.)
  - [ ] Admin dashboard(?)

- [ ] Core
  - [ ] Respectful tracking (DNT)

- [ ] New app: Ideas
  - [ ] Repository for my "you know what would be cool?"

- [ ] Tests
  - [x] Write a few preliminary tests (uncovered a bug!)
  - [ ] Write more comprehensive tests (including functions that hit the DB)


### Frontend

- [ ] Use _less_: trim down Bootstrap + theme to be lighter
  - [ ] Perhaps use tailwind?
- [ ] Establish build pipeline (build bootstrap, etc. from scratch)
