# personal_site
## ChristianKuhl.com
The repo that I develop and work on my personal site

`git push production master` automatically pushes master to the production
server and creates the changes

Python requirements are stored in `requirements.txt` and the virtualenvironment is stored in .venv (but it is git ignored so that everyone builds their own).

## Layout
### Currently
* / (homepage)
    * /about
    * /contact
    * /blog
        * /blog/*posts*
    * /portfolio

### In the future
* add a resume section (replace /about with this?)
