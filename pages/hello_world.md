title: Hello World from ChristianKuhl.com!

This is my first blog post to ChristianKuhl.com -- as much a `Hello World`
to test that my site in fact works, as it is a blog post.

Somehow I got the foolhardy idea into my head that having a website would be a
_really_ good idea. I am still regretting it. But at long last, something
resembling a website is up! I don't expect I will finish it anytime soon,
or if I will ever get it to a state of "finished".

But that's okay.

Neither am I.
