This is my first blog post to ckuhl.com -- as much a `Hello World`
to test that my site in fact works, as it is a blog post.

I got the idea into my head that having a website would be a
_really_ good idea. I am still regretting it. But at long last, something
resembling a website is up! I don't expect I will finish it anytime soon,
or if I will ever get it to a state of "finished".

I guess it's more like that classic car that your neighbor has up on block,
working on it every night. Will it ever get finished? Who knows. However
you do know that he enjoys every second of working on it.
