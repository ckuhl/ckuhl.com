When I first made this site I didn't think it would be that hard to set up.
And the first time, it wasn't really that hard to be honest. It's only when I
tried to be clever and change around some settings that it blew up on me.

I couldn't seem to make it work after that. Back to the tutorial. Second time
around, got it working again. Okay. Don't mess with any weird stuff and it
should work. Should.

It doesn't work.
