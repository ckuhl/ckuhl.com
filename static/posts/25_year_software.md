I am one month into my first co-op job, working as a software developer. Get
any ideas you have of the sexy, sleek software jobs out of your head now. I am
not working on anything even remotely glamorous. I'm programming at a factory.

Now factories aren't inherently a bad place to work at. But when you're
working on software, things are held to a decidedly _low_ standard. If it runs,
it's done. User interface? Documentation? Who needs 'em? _Certainly not us_.

Yeah, yikes.

But at the same time, working here has given me a hell of a realization about
the timescales that software can be developed on. I used to think anything
written 10 years ago was old. Here that counts as new. The Oracle database,
is twenty-five years old. And the mainframe? Yeah it's still kicking around,
as critical to the entire business process as the day it was purchased. So
when they start coding around here, it's not for something to be used for a
year or two until the next version can come out. And it certainly isn't just
an MVP that they're making.
