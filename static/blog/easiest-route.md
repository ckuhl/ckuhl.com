I have found that my most limited resource when it comes to side projects is
not my computing resources or my ideas, but my time. With school obligations
it is often difficult to find the time to complete my projects. The solution
I have found, as unsatisfactory as it feels sometimes, is to do things the easy
way.

While I am trying to accomplish my goal, anything that isn't directly related
is a roadblock to accomplishing it. For example, I want to create my own
website with a blog. Styling and site efficiency isn't a priority to me. So
even though I would love to be able to design it from scratch, I won't.
Designing my website isn't my goal, writing a blog is.
