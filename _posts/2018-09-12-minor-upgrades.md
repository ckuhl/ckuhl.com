As a part of a as-of-yet unnamed overarching project, I've been updating my
presence around the web on various sites. As a part of this I've found the
various links that I am using are often on the longer side, making them difficult to read.

To solve this, I've added a small short link area to my website. Now I can use
`ckuhl.com/s/<descriptor>` to link to other pages on my website, so that
I can use descriptive URLs on the pages, but also create smaller URLs where space
is constrained.
