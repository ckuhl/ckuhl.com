A small project to learn the ropes of how to make web extensions, this
replicates the functionality of [Image Block](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-block/), ensuring that I'll be able to use this
functionality even after Firefox completely deprecates XUL extensions.

With the recent changeover to Firefox 57, a lot of people were left looking for
alternatives to their previously useful extensions. It would appear that I have
positioned my extension properly in that regard, as I have begun to receive
some interest in it. Emails, GitHub issues, reviews, it's quite a change from
the radio silence I had before.

It's also been a beneficial experience for seeing how my "customers" respond to
changes, bug fixes, and various communications. Just being able to respond and
say "Hey, I've seen this and I'll look into it when I get a chance" goes a long
way towards satisfying people's complaints with rough edges around it.
