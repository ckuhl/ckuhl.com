Getting a co-op placement is often stressful enough on its own. But what about
if you end up with a job so far away you have to do everything by wire?

# Step 1: Find a place
Before anything else, its critical to find a place to live. The key
consideration should be location before anything else. Your time has value! If
you have to spend hours a day getting to work, you're paying yourself less!

# Step 2: Get there
Not too tricky, just keep an eye on the cost of one-way vs. two-way flights

# Step 3: Who's with me?
Knowing other people in your situation is an easy way to have some level of
support.
