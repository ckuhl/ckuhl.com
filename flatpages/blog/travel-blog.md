As a co-op student, I am often moving back and forth between school and a new
co-op placement. In itself this is not very noteworthy. It certainly is not
worth blogging about! With my latest co-op job (starting this January), things
are a bit different. This co-op I will be moving to Vancouver!

I am already writing a blog to hone my writing skills. Since it is already set
up, I figure I'll get more utility out of it by also providing updates for my
friends and family (and curious strangers) about what I get up to.

Thanks to the ability of Markdown to include arbitrary HTML, I have a been
able to easily add in
[Lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/) to provide a cleaner viewing
experience. The caveat being, I need to dump a little bit of raw HTML into my
otherwise clean text. But it's worth it to be able to embed images!

<p class="image-container">
<a class="thumbnail-link" href="/static/images/2017-12-06_foggy-waterloo.jpg"
	data-lightbox="travel-blog-1"
	data-title="An example image">
	<img class="thumbnail" src="/static/images/2017-12-06_foggy-waterloo.jpg"
		alt="A foggy day in Waterloo, ON">
</a>
</p>

An example image, embedded for your viewing pleasure (and my testing help).
