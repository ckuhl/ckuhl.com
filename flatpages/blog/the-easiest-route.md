My most limited resource when it comes to side projects is
not my computing resources or my ideas, but my time. With school obligations
it is difficult to find the time to complete my projects. The solution
I have found, while often unsatisfactory, is to do things the easy way.

To explain, while I am trying to accomplish my goal, anything that isn't
directly related to success is a roadblock. For example when I wanted to create
my own website with a blog, style wasn't a priority to me. So even though I
would love to be able to design it from scratch, I didn't. Designing my website
wasn't my goal, writing a blog was (and is).
