Initially an MVP, I have been progressively fleshing out my blog as I have
time, usually with whatever catches my fancy. My latest (re)discovery on this
front has been my love for RSS feeds. Being able to keep up-to-date on blogs
that post rather infrequently is hugely valuable to me. Not only because I can
keep up on content I care about, but also because doing so allows me to avoid
using the internet letss.

With that in mind, the latest update to the site has been to add an RSS feed
(reachable at the URL
[https://ckuhl.com/blog/rss/](https://ckuhl.com/blog/rss/). Again trying to
follow my focus on [taking the easy way](https://ckuhl.com/blog/easiest-route/),
I used the python library [feedgen](https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen)
to do all the heavy lifting for me. Combined with FlatPages for flask, and I
have another handy feature added to my blog in just under an hour.
