As a co-op student, I am often moving back and forth between school and a new
co-op placement. Previously I have been in Niagara Falls and Hamilton, both
fairly close. However with my new job (starting this January), I will be moving
to Vancouver(!).

Now I am already using my blog to hone my writing skills by writing about
technical matters as I learn about them. Since it is already set up, I figure
I'll get some more mileage out of by also providing updates on what I get up
to.

The one technical blockage to doing this is that I have yet to actually
_figure out_ how to embed images into a blog post. For now I am just linking in
entire images. Long-term the goal is to use
[Lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/) to provide a cleaner viewing
experience.
