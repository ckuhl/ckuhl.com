As a co-op student, I am often moving back and forth between school and a new
co-op placement. In itself this is not very noteworthy. It certainly is not
worth blogging about! With my latest co-op job (starting this January), things
are a bit different. This co-op I will be moving to Vancouver!

I am already writing a blog to hone my writing skills. Since it is already set
up, I figure I'll get more utility out of it by also providing updates for my
friends and family (and curious strangers) about what I get up to.

The technical roadblock that I face in starting up a travel blog is that I have
not yet figured out how to nicely include images in a blog post. While for now
I am pursuing the easy solution of embedding entire images, this is not an
optimal reading experience. Long-term my goal is to use
[Lightbox](https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/) to provide a cleaner viewing
experience. However to do this successfully will require that I write an
extension to Python's markdown parser to properly format image tags.
